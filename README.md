# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
This line imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions, including sqrt (square root).
### Step 2: 
This line assigns values to four variables: x1, x2, y1, and y2. These variables represent the coordinates of two points in a 2D plane.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
This line prints the calculated distance, rounded to two decimal places, using the round function.
### Step 5: 
This program calculates and prints the distance between the points (10, 6) and (4, 2) in a 2D plane.
### step 6:
end program
### PROGRAM:
#Program to find the distance  
#Developed by :EASWAR.R  
#Register number:212223230053  

import math  
list1=[4,2]  
list2=[10,6]  
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)  
print("{:.3}".format(distance))

### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Then, the program is successfully executed.
